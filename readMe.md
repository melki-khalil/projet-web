## Notes
This project represents my final website submission. While it lacks some functionality to make it fully operational, it reflects the extent of my current knowledge and effort. Due to limited experience and challenges with mental health, I could not implement every feature I initially planned. Nonetheless, I hope this work meets the expectations and demonstrates my commitment to learning.

Thank you for your understanding.
